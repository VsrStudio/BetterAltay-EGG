Simple Egg
This egg allows you to run a **BetterAltay** Use PHP binary 8.1 from [pmmp/PHP-Binaries](https://github.com/pmmp/PHP-Binaries).

## ❓ What is BetterAltay?

[BetterAltay](https://github.com/Benedikt05/BetterAltay) is a third-party fork of PocketMine-MP designed to provide enhanced performance and features.  
It continues to support **API 3** (legacy plugin compatibility) and includes **complete item and block support** from the Bedrock protocol, which the official PocketMine lacks by default.

BetterAltay is commonly used for servers that require better stability, full item support, or want to run plugins that rely on legacy APIs.
